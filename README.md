# Sankey Diagrams for Relative Bandwidth of Supercomputer Components

For many years I have been giving talks on in situ visualization and other
topics that discuss the comparatively poor performance of storage bandwidth
to the other components of the system. I occasionally have to update the
diagrams for the latest machines.

This repository was started to capture these diagrams and the information
that was used to build them.
